Contemporaneamente all’avvio dei cantieri e contrariamente al progetto originale, venne deciso di trasferire nella nuova area tutta la scuola: a tal fine nel 1915 Donghi elaborò un progetto complessivo che, basandosi su quanto era già in costruzione, fornisse una sede all’intera scuola di Ingegneria. Venne quindi pensato un fabbricato gemello al primo con affaccio su via Marzolo, che avrebbe ospitato gli Istituti di Meccanica Applicata e Macchine, mentre verso Ovest, su via Paolotti, altri due fabbricati a doppia altezza erano destinati agli Istituti di Architettura, Fisica Tecnica e Chimica, collegati da un corpo centrale destinato a ingresso e uffici. Il cantiere venne definitivamente interrotto nell'agosto 1917 a causa della guerra e i lavori ripresero solo nel 1919, secondo un nuovo progetto di Donghi e sotto la direzione dell'allora direttore dell'Ufficio Tecnico dell'Ateneo Giordano Tomasatti, in associazione con il figlio di Donghi, Mario Felice. Per ragioni economiche la costruzione della torre al centro del blocco intermedio tra i due cortili fu rinviata per essere comunque realizzata entro il 1929, come pure dovette attendere i primi anni Trenta la parte centrale del braccio ovest su via Paolotti, destinata ad ingresso principale e allora anche ad accesso particolare degli Istituti di Architettura, di Fisica Tecnica e di Chimica. Durante la seconda Guerra Mondiale l'angolo nord-ovest dell'Istituto di Architettura fu danneggiato da una bomba e, nel dopoguerra, si rese quindi necessaria la ricostruzione di tutta l'ala, sopraelevata fino a raggiungere i due piani di altezza fuori terra: in questa occasione venne anche costruito l'avancorpo a due piani addossato al fronte interno.

Nel 1892 il complesso di edifici venne quindi ceduto dal demanio all’Università di Padova, che lo destinò a sede della Scuola di Applicazione per Ingegneri: nella circostanza venne predisposto un rinnovamento e ampliamento dei locali, su progetto dell\\'ingegner Pio Chicchi, che previde, oltre alla sistemazione del palazzo nobiliare, la demolizione delle adiacenze e l\\'erezione al loro posto di due corpi di fabbrica paralleli, l\\'uno di forma rettangolare verso la strada (oggi Corso del Popolo) e l’altro trapezoidale verso la Conca delle Porte Contarine (oggi via Matteotti), entrambi a due piani e con fronti scandite da lesene a bugnato leggero che inquadrano aperture ad arco verso il cortile, con semplici finestre rettangolari verso l\\'esterno.
